# Retail-Sector-Performance-Analysis-2019-2024
This project analyzes various retail sectors' performance, focusing on the impact of COVID-19 and market trends over the past few years. It includes the analysis of the automobile retail sector to determine the best time to sell a car, an exploration of the fashion retail sector to identify the most impacted sub-categories, and a study on the revenue trends across industries.

üìä Project Overview
Data Sources:
The data is sourced from historical retail sales data, specifically for sectors like automobile dealers and fashion retailers.
The dataset covers the period from 2019 to 2024, which includes pre- and post-COVID periods.
Analysis Focus:
Automobile Retail (Car Sales): Identifying the best months to sell a car based on demand trends.
COVID Impact on Retail Sectors: Comparing the revenue drops between pre-COVID and COVID periods, and identifying the sectors most affected.
Fashion Retail Sectors: Analyzing the recovery of various fashion sub-categories post-COVID.
Deliverables:
Cleaned and pre-processed data.
Visualizations that depict retail trends across different industries.
Insights into the best times to sell a car and which sectors were most impacted by COVID.
üíª Technologies Used
Language:
Python: The primary language used for data analysis and visualization.
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations and calculations.
seaborn: For statistical data visualizations.
matplotlib: For general plotting and customizing visualizations.
üìÇ Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Before running the code, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

Install the required libraries for Python: Run the following command to install all necessary libraries.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
Data File:
Ensure that the dataset file assignment_5_dat_file.csv is placed in the correct directory. Update the file path in the code accordingly:

python
Copy
Edit
data_temp = pd.read_csv(r"C:\path\to\your\data\assignment_5_dat_file.csv")
This file contains the necessary data for analysis and visualization.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project
Download the Data:
Ensure you have the file assignment_5_dat_file.csv in the correct directory.

Install Dependencies:
Run the following command to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
Run the Code:
Once the dependencies are installed and the data is in place, you can run the Python script to generate the visualizations and insights.

Reminder:
Data File Path: Ensure that you replace the file path in the read_csv function with the correct path to your data file.
Library Installation: Make sure you have installed the necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) using pip before running the script.
